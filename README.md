1. Seven Segment Project
I have some project how to drive seven segment with size 3", this my first project with large seven segment. I use IC 74HC595 as shift register and IC ULN2803 to power up at seven segment 3". I think sure, 5volt will not bright seven segment. 

for testing system, I use atmel Studio 7 and ATmega32. Atmel studio is awesome compiler for ATMEL microprocessor. for more detail i write ini https://mikroavr.com/rangkaian-seven-segment/

2. Digital Clock with DS3231
we have tiny project how to make digital clock with Arduino using RTC DS3231 and display to LCD16x2 with interface I2C. So this project will you see two I2C interface, one for DS3231 and other for I2C LCD, for more detail, you can se on my personal website https://mikroavr.com/jam-digital-arduino-ds3231/



Thanks
