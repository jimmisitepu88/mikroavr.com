I have some project how to drive seven segment with size 3", this my first project with large seven segment. I use IC 74HC595 as shift register and IC ULN2803 to power up at seven segment 3". I think sure, 5volt will not bright seven segment. 

for testing system, I use atmel Studio 7 and ATmega32. Atmel studio is awesome compiler for ATMEL microprocessor. for more detail i write ini https://mikroavr.com/rangkaian-seven-segment/
